Consequently, blood organisations in several countries have established governmentally approved investigational protocols for collection and use of CCP. However, other countries still seek advice in this area. Sources of guidance can be found in recent publications by the Working Party on Global Blood Safety of the International Society of Blood Transfusion (ISBT), the ISBT Convalescent Plasma Working Group, and the World Health Organization. Additionally, resources on CCP policies and protocols can be found at an ISBT open-access website: http://isbtweb.org/coronaoutbreak/convalescent-plasma-covid-19-resources/.The effectiveness and safety of CCP remain uncertain based on limitations of the available controlled studies and reported case series and fundamental questions regarding optimal use in patient management are unanswered. Nevertheless, in the absence of an established treatment for COVID-19, with promising trends supporting its safety and effectiveness, and with the potential for local production, CCP remains a priority for investigational use. In all countries, experimental collection and use of CCP require ethical oversight and the assurance of product quality and safety through an organized national program.

Most African countries remain seriously unprepared to handle the pandemic of the nature the Western world is dealing with; Africa, from Mali to Ethiopia to Libya and down to South Africa, have insufficient ventilators or intensive care beds to cope with COVID-19 should it strike with ferocity as it is doing in the Western world. As COVID-19 reaches the shores of Africa, despite poor health facilities, poor living conditions and inadequate availability of clean water across the continent, Africans are still putting up a fight taking COVID-19 head on with use of cheap technology, and help from the continent’s protective climate. However, Africa cannot afford to be complacent. African countries must continue to adopt strict social distancing measures, educate their people on the importance of intake of regular vitamin D, good exercising habit, good sleep pattern, adequate hand hygiene measures, as well as strictly enforcing the “test, trace and isolate“ model to the letter for the continent to take on the fight head on and wage a proper war against COVID-19.

Since then, the number of cases has continued to increase with Ethiopia, the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), Nigeria, Sudan, Angola, Tanzania, Ghana, and Kenya identified as vulnerable countries. The present study aimed to: 1) identify differences in trust level of COVID-19 diagnosis, recent healthcare utilization experiences, and COVID-19-related knowledge, information, and prevention practices in South Korea, Ethiopia, and DRC; and 2) identify factors influencing trust level in healthcare facilities regarding COVID-19 diagnosis. The present study was cross-sectional. The questionnaire survey was conducted between May 1–14, 2020 using Google forms, and 748 respondents were included in the final analysis. The data collected were analyzed using ANOVA, post-hoc test, and binary logistic regression analysis. South Korea showed higher rate of practice for COVID-19 prevention such as hand washing, mask wearing, and etc. than Ethiopia and DRC. The results showed significant differences with the trust level being 3.129 times higher in respondents from DRC than those from Ethiopia (aOR=3.129, 95% CI: [1.884-5.196], p<.000) and 29.137 times higher in respondents from South Korean than those from Ethiopia (aOR=29.137, 95% CI: [13.869-61.210], p<.000).

As of July 27, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) reported 712,920 COVID-19 cases in Africa, with 11,900 deaths, and a case fatality rate of 1.7%1. These cases in the African continent account for 4.4 % of the total number of 16,114,449 cases of COVID-19 reported in the six WHO world regions during the same period. The 11,900 deaths in Africa accounts for approximately 1.8 % of the 646,641 associated with global deaths. Of note, is the observation that a preponderance of the cases and mortality in Africa (up to 70%) are concentrated in five countries – Algeria, Egypt, Nigeria, South Africa, and Ghana1.This special edition of the African Journal of Reproductive Health (AJRH) features primary research, commentaries, and reviews on the COVID-19 pandemic experiences within Africa's context. Being a continent with unusual developmental challenges and health systems characteristics, it was evident right from the beginning that the virus would manifest in ways different from the rest of the world. The AJRH is uniquely positioned to report the specific indicators of the pandemic in the African continent as revealed in this special edition. From the papers presented, four major concerns and characteristics that seem to epitomize the relative understanding or misunderstanding of the virus within the context of African countries are highlighted. First, there is the perception in many of the published research findings and commentaries that the rates and mortality from COVID-19 in Africa may be low as compared to other parts of the world2,3.While the emerging data on incidence and mortality statistics of the pandemic in corresponding regions of the world may have substantiated this view, it has not considered the deficiencies that have been inherent in the chronicling of the pandemic in the African continent. The other regions of the world have done relatively well in the rate of testing of populations for the virus. Still, many African countries have continued to lag in this indicator. Currently, a total of COVID-19 tests per 1,000 population of 158.98, 129.9, and 108.51 have been reported from the USA, the UK, and Italy respectively4. By contrast, South Africa, with the highest rate of testing in Africa, has a total test per 1,000 of 46.044. Nigeria, a country with the highest population in Africa of over 205 million persons, has currently tested 1.27 per 10004, with only 267,842 persons tested since the pandemic began in the country5. Indeed, if the rate of positives of 41,180 in the 267,842 persons tested for the virus in Nigeria is considered (15.4% rate of positivity), it is evident that many more persons are positive in the country5. The perceived low incidence of COVID-19 in Africa is a mismatch against the available data. It must not be taken as gospel until more data and better rates of testing for the virus are achieved widely on the continent.The second dimension in consideration of COVID-19 in Africa is the observation that while many countries have struggled to provide health and social services to restrain the virus, there has been the fear that other essential health services are being neglected in the African continent. Several articles and commentaries in this edition of AJRH allude to this perspective, with major concerns being raised for the resulting deficits in the management of sexual and reproductive health services6-8.With African countries currently experiencing the worst indicators of reproductive, maternal, and child health9, it has been posited that with the emergence of COVID-19 and the resultant reduced access of women and children to evidence-based services, these indicators would worsen10thus, limiting the prospects for achieving the Sustainable Development Goals related to health and social equity in the continent. Indeed, with the lockdowns and economic restrictions that have featured as part of theapproaches for limiting the virus in the continent, it has been proposed that many more unwanted pregnancies, unsafe abortion, and unwanted births will occur.While these concerns are justified, this journal's position is that empirical evidence are needed to document the effects and impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on Africa's health systems, especially its effects on the provision of alternative health services. In particular, we call for the development of innovative interventions and approaches within national health systems to limit the pandemic and ensure the continuity and high-impact delivery of essential services. Such interventions would be tested with true experimental (randomized controlled trial) or quasi-experimental designs to provide evidence-based outcomes for effective service delivery that can be scaled for use globally and to curtail future pandemics.A third debate that has featured repeatedly during the COVID-19 pandemic in the African continent is the role of traditional versus orthodox methods of treatment. To date, there are no vaccines or effective medications for the treatment of the virus. The recommendation by WHO for the use of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin has emboldened many African scientists to envision the development of local remedies for the disease particularly because hydroxychloroquine (the synthetic version of quinine derived from a medicinal plant)11 has been used for the treatment of malaria in Africa for many years. In particular, many argue that since herbal medicines, have been used for the treatment of malaria, it is possible that such drugs could be useful for the treatment of COVID-19 as well.In this context, many African countries are working on providing indigenous treatment for the virus. The AJRH affirms that while efforts to find indigenous treatment for COVID-19 are commendable, such efforts must follow time-honored research protocols and procedures using proven scientific methods.A fourth and final challenge identified for COVID-19 in the articles published in this edition of the AJRHis the current lack of fidelity and trust among Africans about the virus and the preventative strategies known to curtail the spread of the virus. The WHO recommends testing, quarantine of infected persons, self-isolation, handwashing, and the use of sanitizers and facemasks to prevent the community spread of the disease12. However, despite the widespread knowledge of these prevention measures, the compliance with the recommendations has been low, especially in countries that are currently witnessing an upsurge in transmission rates. In Nigeria, for example, new cases of the virus are emerging despite several weeks of lockdowns and sustained dissemination of information on prevention. This observation has been attributed to a lack of trust among community constituents about the real essence of the virus and the effectiveness of health measures designed to curtail its spread. Many observers doubt the existence of the virus, with some proposing explanatory models that range from the mundane to the ridiculous.The paper by Lee et al13 in this edition of the journal provides empirical data to substantiate the lack of trust of health systems among African populations as compared to other parts of the world. It presented a cross-sectional study comparing trust levels in health recommendations for COVID-19 between respondents in Ethiopia, the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), and South Korea. The study revealed that trust levels were three times higher in DRC than in Ethiopia, and 29 times higher in South Korea than in Ethiopia. The paper recommended a need for rapid scaling of health education, information, and practices in the two African populations studied. Indeed, we believe that strategies to curtail the spread of the virus in Africa must include sustained efforts to disseminate accurate information, eliminate skepticism, and build community understanding.We conclude that African countries have specific peculiarities in the experience of COVID-19 that may hinder or propel the virus's elimination sooner or later. This special edition of the AJRH has highlighted some of the challenges and peculiarities to foster Africa's contribution to the early curtailment of the pandemic. While many parts of the developed world are witnessing a declining incidence of the virus, African populations seem to be on the accelerating phase of its development. We fear that unless specific measures are taken to counter some of the misunderstandings about the virus and the challenges facing its prevention in Africa, the disease might fester for a more extended period in the continent than is currently envisaged.",11/08/2020,,,2,24,,,COVID-19,,,,,,,en,Copyright (c) 2020 African Journal of Reproductive Health

Let’s not beat about the Bush,African Journal of Reproductive Health,,2131-3606,,https://www.ajrh.info/index.php/ajrh/article/view/2286,"Except for such rare situations where it might be determined absence of physician’s imputability, physicians cannot ‘save the most lives while respecting the legal rights of the patient’ without violating the overarching principle ‘every human life has equal value’.  Arguing to the contrary is a conscious hypocritical attitude, or in other words, a fiction. Medical law and ethics long since carry with its various fictions. Furthermore, in a public health emergency such as the current COVID-19 crisis, medical law and ethics change and shift the focus from the patient-centered model towards the public health-centered model. Under these particular circumstances, this fiction becomes striking, and it can no longer be swept under the rug. As health emergencies can happen anywhere, anytime, the patient prioritization in circumstances of limited resources should be accepted. Medical law and ethics should back away from strict commitment to placing paramount emphasis on the value of human life. It is time for medical law and ethics to leave taboo-related hypocritical attitudes, and venture to make a historic compromise. To do so, three principles should be met: subsidiarity, proportionality, and consensus and social proof.

With the epicentre of the outbreak projected to shift to sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) after making significant impact in China, Europe, USA, and South America, it is necessary for countries in this region to begin to plan for how to tackle a rapid surge in cases. Health facilities are already being primed for increased presentation of COVID-19 cases. As countries prepare, they also need to consider how non-urgent services will not be interrupted. Estimates of a potential disruption in access to long and short acting contraceptives for up to 12 months will result in an additional 15 million unintended pregnancies and additional 28,000 maternal deaths. Thus, effort must be made to ensure that the gains made in SRH outcomes over several years are not lost. The potential of utilizing telemedicine to continue to offer healthcare services to the population for non-urgent care needs to be considered. It will not only provide for continued access to important services that can be delivered remotely but will reduce the risks of COVID-19 infection for both the client and the health workers.

In the face of this threat, the Sustainable Developmental Goals that call on the global community to “leave no one behind” may become a blurred vision unless we adopt a wider lens away from the tunnel vision that currently plagues health systems around the globe. This paper therefore exposes how SRH may become collateral damage in the face of the present COVID-19 pandemic. Previous disease outbreaks diverted attention from critical SRH services, including antenatal care, safe abortions, contraception, HIV/AIDS and sexually transmitted infections.   Governments, policy makers, health system gatekeepers and civil society organisations should not allow the COVID-19 phobia to bar women and adolescent girls from accessing SRH services. In fact, the global and South African response to the COVID-19 pandemic must protect everyone’s rights, particularly in the health care context. Gender considerations and a human rights approach must be embedded in ensuring the accessibility and availability of SRH services.

As primary health care clinicians and research collaborators in maternal health, we have some observations based on our experiences. While our clinical work is done in two very different settings: a rural Tanzanian district hospital (Chirangi) and an urban Canadian city (Webber), we have noted some commonalities in the response to the pandemic. Covid 19 has made people very afraid. The media images of over-run Italian hospitals with insufficient ventilators for very ill patients and exhausted staff has permeated all of our borders. People are avoiding getting health care, because they know that they are at risk of contracting this virus, with no cure or vaccine to help them. As a result, instead of being overwhelmed with sick patients, Canadian hospital emergency rooms are in fact quieter than usual. Elective surgeries have been postponed, and staff are being re-deployed. Our social distancing policies have appeared to flatten the epidemic curve in the general community (though unfortunately, not in longterm homes). Similarly, in rural Tanzania, people are avoiding getting health care services until they are very sick. Fear of leaving home to go to the more populated town, where there may be a greater risk of infection, is strong. We know from the Ebola epidemic in West Africa that women’s health suffered because either the health system was overwhelmed with Ebola patients, or the population believed they would be at risk of acquiring the virus when attending a health facility1. The outcome was the same - limited access to needed health care services and declines in maternal health.How can a primary health care system ensure that the population continues to have sound health care services during a pandemic? The first criteria are a close personal connection to the health care system. For example, in Canada most Canadians have a family physician who helps them navigate health care. The pandemic has changed how family physicians work; however, we have the benefit of a long-term relationship with our patients. Even during times of social distancing, we can use the telephone or video conferencing tools to help manage the health problems of our patients and choose who needs to be seen and whose health problems can be managed at a distance. With respect to reproductive health, we can ensure women have access to contraceptive services, and continue to see our pregnant patients in virus-free spaces (though we have learned that we may not need to see them as often as we once thought). We can make sure that newborns are growing well and that they receive their childhood vaccinations. Most importantly, as community-based, primary health care providers, we can keep our patients away from potentially infectious places such as emergency rooms. We are fortunate to have a strong public health system which has provided alternative clinics for those people who have Covid symptoms. Keeping the ill separate from mothers and babies is an important strategy that we will need to take forward into our future health care planning.In rural Africa, the primary health care system is built upon community health workers collaborating with dispensary nurses to attend to the health needs of the population. It is the relationships of the community health workers with local families which is key to maintaining the health of the community. This is particularly true for reproductive health care services such as family planning and antenatal care. In many regions in Africa, community health workers have been trained to assist women access family planning and prenatal services. We propose this relationship needs to be strengthened during a pandemic, when women are less likely to leave their communities for health care. The community health workers need more support at this time - both through phone supervision and through provision of supplies which they can distribute to community members. Community health workers must be trained and supported to refer women with danger signs for higher levels of care.  In our research in rural Tanzania, in addition to referring pregnant women with danger signs, trained community health workers can safely distribute condoms and oral contraception and educate women about more advanced family planning methods that can be obtained through a local health facility such as depoprovera injections, implants and intrauterine devices2. During a pandemic, it makes sense to train community health workers to provide injectable contraception to interested women in the villages, allowing the women to avoid a trip (and possible exposure) at a local clinic. Community health workers can also check on pregnant women and children, and screen them and refer for any serious health conditions, including symptoms of Covid 19. Supportive supervision is key to making this work. Finally, providing birth kits with misoprostol in rural settings is another strategy to ensure women have supplies they need at the time of delivery. While skilled birth attendance is always a goal for every woman, failures in supply chains, challenges with transportation and now fears of contagion may prevent women from accessing health care services. Having clean supplies and misoprostol tablets to take postpartum can help prevent postpartum hemorrhage and sepsis - two of the most common causes of maternal deaths3. Strengthening the provision of community-based care is one important strategy to address reproductive health for the women and infants living in rural Africa. Now is the time to invest in these services, to limit the impact of this global pandemic.",11/08/2020,,,2,24,,,In Support of Community-based Primary Health Care,,,,,,,en,Copyright (c) 2020 African Journal of Reproductive Health

The study employed cross country comparison to conclude the effectiveness of the various measures implemented by different countries.  Seven key phrases were searched, and the results were considered for analysis and presentation. The data were analyzed using the paired sample t-test and spearman's correlation coefficient. The USA and South Africa are on the exponential growth phase for the total number of infections per day. At the same time, South Korea and Taiwan were able to contain the virus. Western Cape is the epicenter of coronavirus cases in South Africa. The extensive production of face masks, quarantine measures, banning overseas travel, physical distancing, monitoring self-isolating individuals may help to contain the virus. In South Africa, banning the interprovincial movement may keep the spread to a minimum.

This commentary analyzed the global epidemiology of COVID-19 among the vulnerable population. The analysis revealed that most pediatric COVID-19 cases are not severe, but related severe illness still occurs in children. All ages of children are susceptible to COVID-19, and no significant gender difference exists. COVID-19 infection during pregnancy produced fatal outcomes for mothers, but less risky for the baby. The hot spot clusters for COVID-19 are the prisons/jails, nursing/group homes, and long-term facilities where most of the vulnerable populations reside. Ethnic minority groups in the USA and UK are disproportionately exposed to COVID-19 infection and death than Caucasians. The difference may be because ethnic minorities are exposed to higher risks at work and the long-standing structural economic and health disparities in the two countries.

The aim of this paper was to explore the experiences of social work students and educators vis-à-vis emergency remote teaching and learning and the implications thereof on social work education. The paper adopts a qualitative approach, collecting data through telephonic interviews. Data analysis was thematic. The findings reveal that students expressed feelings of anguish, frustration and a worthless future. Furthermore, they reported that rural infrastructure presents terrifying moments at home, because of limited accessibility to internet connectivity. Social work educators expressed frustration with online teaching and doubted its success.

One of the strategies to control the spread of COVID-19 disease is expanding laboratory diagnosis services. So far, the molecular biology-based real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) method is the only recommended laboratory test to diagnose the disease. However, during COVID-19 infection, hematology, immunology, and clinical chemistry test profile changes might also assist in diagnosing the disease. Objective: The objective of this systematic review was “assessment of routine hematology, immunology, and clinical chemistry test profile changes among COVID-19 RT-PCR laboratory tests positive individuals”, which, before such tests are carried out, might suggest the occurrence of COVID-19 infection. Material and methods: The systematic review was done to assess general epidemiology, routine clinical chemistry and hematology/ immunohematology tests done in association with COVID-19 diagnosed cases. Online published articles were searched using PubMed, Hinari, AGORA and Google Scholar search engines, based on the following inclusion criteria: articles on COVID-19 that focus on human coronavirus diseases, their epidemiology, laboratory diagnosis of such diseases, the RT-PCR test, and additional routine laboratory tests. Exclusion criteria included articles that discuss the RT-PCR method only, imaging diagnostic methods, and those that focus on specific groups (such as COVID-19 among diabetes patients, cancer patients and so on). Accordingly, a total of 75 research articles were identified. Of these, 29 papers were selected for systematic review. Results: From the collected 29 articles on routine clinical chemistry tests, it was concluded that in confirmed COVID-19 cases, aminotransferase enzymes – alanine transaminase (ALT) and aspartate transaminase (AST) – bilirubin, creatine kinase (CK), troponin, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), creatine  and ferritin values were relatively high, whereas the albumin value was reduced. In the hematology/immunohematology tests, total white blood cell (WBC) counts, neutrophil counts, erythrocyte sedimentation rates (ESR), C-reactive protein (CRP) and prothrombin time (PT) increased, whereas lymphocyte counts, platelet counts, and cluster of differentiation 4 (CD4) and cluster of differentiation 8 (CD8) counts decreased. In addition, neutrophil-lymphocyte (N-L) ratios increased, whereas lymphocyte-C-reactive protein (L-C) ratios decreased. Conclusions: For those individuals with signs and symptoms of COVID-19, leukocytosis with neutrophilia and lymphopenia, high N-L and low L-C ratios, mild increases in aminotransferase and creatinine values with increased CK, troponin and ferritin levels, might be considered as “routine laboratory test results that are supportive of occurrence COVID-19 disease”.

Since it was first reported in December 31, 2019 in the Hubei province of China, at the time of writing, over 2 million people have been infected, with over 127,598 deaths in 202 countries and territories. Records of global distribution show a steady increase, although the USA is leading in its distribution, with Italy reporting close to 20,000 deaths. The purpose of this rapid review is to synthesize available evidence on the epidemiology, pathogenesis, diagnosis and public health control measures to inform policy, programs and research on COVID-19. Methods: A rapid review method was employed using PubMed and Google Scholar search engines. Journal articles, reports and government documents were included in our search, which is focused on the disease epidemiology, advancements in diagnostics, treatment and vaccines, public health control measures, and psychosocial interventions for health care providers. The contents of the identified articles were examined and abstracted by a team of investigators. The concepts represented by the individual reviews were collated to give a complete picture of COVID-19 based on the evidence we have so far. The search period spanned December 30, 2019 to April 15, 2020. Findings: The severity of the disease and its fast spread, three times faster than the flu, has challenged the health systems of almost every country in the world. Although, for now, the case burden remains low in Africa, the impact of COVID-19 is anticipated to be severe if it becomes widespread. Efforts to curb the pandemic, involving prevention, disease surveillance, contact tracing, clinical management and the development of new treatments and diagnostics, is ongoing across the globe. While writing this review, more than 73 vaccines are at the exploratory or preclinical stage, while two are in phase I clinical trialsYet, non-pharmaceutical interventions are critical to stopping the spread of the virus. Africa, in particular, should put extra effort into making preventive public health measures work, because health systems in the continent are too weak to withstand the effect of the pandemic should it hit hard, and the economic implications of extreme control measures following a delayed response would be severe. On the bright side, the lessons drawn from this pandemic are likely to improve the preparedness and response to similar future outbreaks and pandemics. [Ethiop. J.

However, still, there is scarce information regarding the knowledge, attitude, and practice (KAP) of students towards COVID-19 pandemic. Thus, this study aimed to assess the KAP and associated factors of preventive measures against COVID- 19 among students.METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted on 422 students. The sample was proportionally allocated into the randomly selected four colleges, and the students were recruited using a systematic random sampling technique.Variables with pvalue < 0.25 in the bivariate logistic regression analysis were entered into the multivariable logistic regression model.RESULTS: This study involved 408 students with response rate of 96.6%. The levels of good knowledge, positive attitude and good practice towards COVID-19 were 69.6%, 56.6% and 65% respectively. After adjusting for covariates, being in the late adolescent age group (16-20), living with > 5 family size, and being single were predictors of knowledge level. Besides, being single, attending diploma (TVET) level trainings, and being year-two students were predictors of attitude levels. Similarly, urban residence, being regular students, and being year-one students were the independent predictors of practice level of students.CONCLUSION: In this study, only two-third of the students had good preventive practice level towards COVID-19, which is below the Organization’s recommendation. Thus, the national, regional and local governments should develop effective and inclusive prevention strategies to address students who are at home due to COVID-19 pandemic.",01/01/2021,,,1,31,,,"Preventive Practice and Associated Factors towards COVID-19 among College Students in Amhara Region, Ethiopia",,,,,,,en,Copyright (c)

Prominent amongst these were unprecedented job losses and an increase in gender-based violence. These were based on the assumptions that due to the lockdown (i) many people will lose jobs, and (ii) people will be constrained to stay together and as a result, gender-based violence will escalate. On the one hand, South Africa was one of the countries that experienced a high incidence of the pandemic and implemented very strict lockdown measures to contain it with relative success. On the other, the country is also ranked high amongst those with records of gender-based violence in normal times. This paper investigated whether retrenchments led to an increase in gender-based violence during the COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown in South  Africa. It focused between March and June 2020 described as a period of the ""hard-lockdown"" in the country. Based on our analysis of available  data, we found out that many intervening variables interacted with the impacts of the pandemic. We also observed that these may have moderated behaviours that influenced inter-gender relations; as a result, gender-based violence appeared not to have increased as speculated in the country during the period under review.

In the aftermath of disasters, affected communities will need help to restart agricultural activities as soon as possible, in order to meet household food security needs adequately and restore resilience. In some societies, women and/or children are the victims of food discrimination. It is essential to ensure that women and men who live in low-income households are fully integrated in food security interventions for achieving critical development goals. Strides have been made to ensure meaningful participation of affected groups, including women and girls, in decision-making and implementation.

It employed an interpretive qualitative approach. A sample of six teachers teaching Grade 4 were purposively selected from a district in the province of KwaZulu-Natal in South Africa. Data were collected through unstructured interviews. Findings revealed that teachers in rural monolingual community schools find it difficult to meet the policy prescriptions and curriculum demands in terms of the language of learning and teaching. Teachers end up translating into the mother tongue, which is isiZulu, and code-switching to enhance content understanding; this is a strategy that limits both teachers’ and learners’ exposure to English. In addition, learners transitioning from their Home language to English as the language of learning are not sufficiently supported. The findings also indicate that teachers in rural monolingual community schools in King Cetshwayo district find it difficult to meet the curriculum demands in terms of the language of learning and teaching. Teachers were also found to be not very proficient in English. The significance of the study relates to the educational issues of rural schools that are ignored by officialdom, including the fact that teachers are not adequately prepared to teach in English. In addition, learners transitioning to the very unfamiliar language of learning and teaching are not sufficiently supported with regard to improving their command of the language. Hence, policies need revision to address thelinguistic shortcomings of teachers and learners.

Prior to COVID-19 pandemic, most African countries’ main target market were international tourists. Travelling within African countries has been more expensive and challenging. African countries like the rest of the world, are currently working on their recovery strategies to sustain the tourism industry. The current study aimed at exploring tourism niche areas to advance tourism within the African continent post COVID-19. The evaluation research was used to review tourism travel patterns and buying behaviour prior to COVID19 and consequently during the  pandemic. This research method also provided the researcher an ability to propose programme of actions post COVID-19. Additionally, phenomenography research analysis was found applicable for the study to analyse an understanding and perception of African countries on tourism post COVID-19. The study argues that due to strict governments restrictions, fear on long haul destination visits, high prices as a recovery strategy by tourism businesses, many Africans, especially those intend travelling for leisure purpose will opt for intra-continental travel. As a  recovery strategy, African countries need to use social media and other online platforms to promote their countries within Africa. History and culture is rich and diverse in each of the African countries and should be promoted within.

Through a review of literature, this paper aims to explore the field of social work in addressing gender-based violence during COVID- 19. Given the paucity of literature concerning the role of social work during the pandemic, this paper concludes that social work must be used as a useful resource to address GBV during the COVID-19 pandemic. Social workers could use this time to gain new knowledge regarding its preparedness and response to the pandemic. Additionally, this period could be an opportunity to assess government responses and initiatives in addressing GBV, lessons learnt and develop strategies that respond to women’s needs.

The political overtures that the newly elected president, Emmerson Mnangagwa, attempted to give to Chamisa were snubbed by the opposition. In the wake of these political contestations, Covid-19 became a global pandemic that also affected Zimbabwe. Like other countries globally, Zimbabwe instituted mitigation measures, central to which were lockdowns that restricted the movement and curtailed on certain freedoms. The government was accused of using these limitations on freedoms to dismantle the strong opposition from the Movement for Democratic Change - Alliance (MDC-A) and its allies in civil society while propping up pliant and insignificant opposition political parties. The government also sought to increase its visibility on the ground while overshadowing the opposition. While this was the popular narrative, the opposition also took active and reactive measures to the action government took to prop itself up and portray the government in bad light. All this action amounted to the use of Covid–19 politics as political capital from both sides of the political divide. This paper analyses the use of the pandemic for political gain and concludes that all sides had their share of blame for the government’s actions, which only become more visible because of its control of state coercive apparatus. This paper is purely a desk research paper, using credible internet sources. Other sources used include legal documents from Zimbabwe as well as televised and written news which were also used in the form of a virtual observation of the events by the author, even though the sources could not be used independently, given the disjointed nature of global news that follows multiple events without in-depth coverage of most of them, of which Zimbabwe was one of such cases.

Research has shown that the origin of this virus is unknown but what is known it is an unseen silent killer which can only be detected through coughing, shortness of breath, chills and other symptoms. The doctors cannot find the cure because they cannot trace its origin but they know the symptoms which are seen as remedial action not per se the real cure. What governments of the world are doing to curb the spread not the disease and that in itself is problematic in enforcing remedial protocols due to the nature of some of the precautions. Some measures which are in place has eradicated intimacy and closeness amongst people especially through touching. One of the aspect of African spirituality is intimacy and in underpinned on African philosophy wherein people live together in harmony and sees each other as brothers and sister. In African philosophy intimacy is not just based on sex but embraces relationship that is why when African meet they greet each other through touching and shaking hands, hugging and kissing.

These lockdowns albeitimposed to keep people healthy and safe, have had tremendous negative impacts on business, especially those that require frequent movement and face-to-face contact with people. However, during lockdowns, one still needs to fend for self and family members, but without being able to work, there is no likelihood any income, even if government gives palliatives, it might not be enough to take care of critical needs of the family. Of note, a large percentage of households in South Africa are female-headed and as such, they often bear a larger burden in providing for themselves and children even prior COVID-19 outbreak not to mention during the course of the pandemic.

There is limited information on the safety of drugs used for the treatment of COVID-19.Objective: Objective of this study is to describe the pattern of stimulated spontaneous adverse drug reaction (ADR) reports received from healthcare professionals for SARS-CoV-2 positive patients in Ghana and lessons learnt particularly for low- and middle-income countries.Methods: This is a study of individual case safety reports (ICSRs) received from healthcare professionals between 1st April 2020 to 31st July 2020 in SARS-CoV-2 positive patients in Ghana. The ICSRs were retrieved from the SafetyWatch System and descriptive statistics used to describe the ADRs by System Organ Classification and Preferred Term.Results: Information was received from 40 COVID-19 Treatment Centres across the country with 9 centres submitting a total of 53 ICSRs containing 101 ADRs; approximately two ADRs per ICSR. Females accounted for 29(54.7%) of the ICSRs and males 24(45.3%).

China adopted a raft of measures that included prescribing a lockdown on Wuhan and construction of infrastructure such as hospitals. In 2020, COVID-19 extended its tentacles across the globe. A majority of countries adopted the lockdown as a mitigatory measure. The lockdown activated an extraordinary instant emergency in the education sector as schools, colleges and universities shut down. What worsened the situation was that no solution was in sight as the medical researchers dithered from one suggestion to the other. This paper examines possible ways to deal with the emergency in the education sector by suggesting alternative learning solutions. The major argument of this paper is that countries should not simply copy and paste solutions that are not in sync with their local settings. Using the multistage designs sampling technique, three universities from a target of eighteen were selected. Convenience sampling was used to select the three universities and analytic rubrics were used to analyse clarity of policy and disaster preparedness by universities in Zimbabwe. For comparative purposes, four international webinars on education and COVID-19 were selected. This paper contributes towards addressing the lacunae created by global lockdown and subsequent shutdown of learning institutions due to COVID-19. The findings were that the lockdown approach was adopted and implemented without adaptation. Learning institutions were closed indefinitely despite the economic environment, the digital divide and the rural-urban divide militating against lockdown’s entire adoption. Key proposals to deal with the lockdown include scaling up distance education  based on mixed technologies, a paradigm shift on perceptions on digital education and resuscitation of postal services.

As a result, students were obliged to change their learning habits due to school closures radically. This article aims to analyze the factors and challenges faced by students who change their learning habits to maintain remote learning. First, a correlation was calculated on the dataset to select the most influencing factors on the students’ learning habits during the lockdown period. Then, the Generalized Nonlinear Model was used to predict and measure the influence of these variables on the learning hours spent to maintain students’ learning. Finally, the results show that four factors most affect student learning habits and increase their learning time, which are digital technologies used awareness of self-learning progress, and knowledge needed to maintain environmental development and the format of digital resources provided.

Cet article vise à analyser les facteurs et les défis auxquels sont confrontés les étudiants qui changent leurs habitudes d'apprentissage pour s’adapter à l'apprentissage à distance. Premièrement, une corrélation a été calculée sur l'ensemble des données pour sélectionner les facteurs les plus influents sur les habitudes d'apprentissage des étudiants pendant la période de verrouillage. Ensuite, un modèle non linéaire généralisé a été utilisé pour prédire et mesurer l’influence de ces variables sur les heures d’apprentissage passées pour maintenir l’apprentissage des étudiants. Enfin, les résultats montrent qu'il existe quatre facteurs qui affectent le plus les habitudes d'apprentissage des étudiants et augmentent leur temps d'apprentissage, à savoir les technologies numériques utilisées, la prise de conscience des progrès de l'auto-apprentissage, les connaissances nécessaires pour maintenir un environnement en développement et le format des ressources numériques fourni.

The scale of the analysis was of an international level, with special focus on countries suffering from food insecurity such as Algeria. Toward this end, data provided by the Food Agriculture Organization (FAO), and the World Health Organization (WHO) have been analyzed, as well as studies conducted and published on the subject. The findings indicate that Covid 19 has had a huge impact on perishable food and caused remarkable food shortages in poor countries, conflict zones and war-affected regions. Additionally, Covid 19 threatened food security even in some developed, whereas developing countries are the most affected due to their high dependency in securing their food supplies. Finally, based on the findings, we have suggested some recommendations that would help boosting sustainable food security.

De ce fait, le but de cette étude est d'analyser et discuter de l'impact de la Covid 19 sur la sécurité alimentaire. Le niveau d'analyse a une dimension internationale, notamment les pays qui souffrent d'une insécurité alimentaire tel que l'Algérie. Pour cet effet, des données fournies par l'Organisation des Nations Unies pour l’Alimentation et l'Agriculture (FAO), et de l'Organisation mondiale de la santé (OMS) on été analysées, ainsi que des études menées et publiées sur le sujet. Les résultats indiquent que la Covid 19 a eu un impact énorme sur les produits périssables et a également provoqué des pénuries alimentaires dans les pays pauvres, les zones de conflit et les régions touchées par les guerres. En outre, la Covid 19 a menacé la sécurité alimentaire même dans certains pays développés, quant au pays en voie de développement, ce sont les plus touchés en raison de leur dépendance au pays développés. À la fin, sur la base des résultats, nous avons suggéré quelques recommandations qui peuvent contribuer à garantir une sécurité alimentaire durable.

COVID-19 therapeutics has focused on traditional public health outbreak response tactics-isolation, quarantine, social distancing, and community containment. Specific antiviral agents, anti parasitic agents  are being tried as off label treatments for COVID-19 in the absence of efficacious and safe drugs that have undergone multi centre clinical  trials. Though remdesivir currently has Emergency use authorization (EUA) based on preliminary study, drug regulatory bodies had previously issued EUA to allow hydroxy-chloroquine sulfate and chloroquine phosphate to be used for certain hospitalized patients with COVID-19 pending when a clinical trial is available or feasible. There are cardiovascular related adverse effects particularly QT prolongation and Torsade de Pointes (TdP) which is accentuated when  chloroquine is administered with other QT prolonging drugs or in the presence of metabolic conditions favoring QT prolongation.This review raises the real concern that significant percentage of  COVID-19 patients have risk factors which includes: concomitant use of chloroquine and Azithromycin together, background heart disease in patients with hypertension and diabetes mellitus, factors leading to electrolyte imbalance,  that increase their likelihood of having prolonged QT and TdP. Proper assessment of all patients on chloroquine will be required to reduce the chances of TdP and sudden death. COVID-19 patients who need chloroquine therapy should have a baseline assessment. A risk score has been derived and validated by Tisdale et al, for prediction of drug-associated QT prolongation and can be adapted for COVID-19 patients on chloroquine therapy. If chloroquine-induced TdP has occurred, the patients should be triaged into stable and unstable class. The stable patients are likely to have a spontaneous termination of TdP particularly after withdrawal of chloroquine and other drug-inducing QT prolonging therapy or metabolic derangement. For the stable patients, intravenous magnesium is the first line of choice even in patients with normal magnesium levels.

This virus was identified in December 2019. Initial cases were identified in Wuhan, China and linked with a popular sea food market. Mode of spread is by droplets or by direct or indirect contact. All over the world, health workers and other individuals have been affected with death recorded on a daily basis from different countries. Fever, cough, myalgia, anosmia, headache, sorethroat, shortness of breath are common presenting symptoms with atypical symptoms seen in older adults with medical comorbidities. Diagnosis is by nucleic acid amplification test. The real time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay are used for the detection of viral ribonucleic acid, viral sequencing can also be useful to monitor viral genome mutations. Countries all over the world are using different treatment protocols as the disease condition is evolving. Azithromycin and Hydroxychloroquine combination was used in our institution, Olabisi Onabanjo University Teaching Hospital, Sagamu with positive responses as all the confirmed patients (23) admitted were discharged home. Control of this disease depends on rapid identification of cases, isolation of probable and suspect cases as well as quarantine of contacts. Although the association of this disease with race has not been fully established as almost all races are affected, the contributory factors and causes of the low rate, severity and mortality recorded in the pandemic in sub-saharan Africa so far are yet to be established.

Many biochemical changes have beenassociated with COVID‑19. This study is aimed to establish an association between various inflammatory markers and the severity ofCOVID‑19 to provide knowledge for the clinicians and help professionals that manage the disease. Methods: A search in PubMed/Medline, Google scholar, and Journal Storage (JSTOR) databases was conducted from May 15, 2020 to June 15, 2020, for studies that reported serum levels of inflammatory markers in COVID‑19. Search terms included a combination of “medical laboratory diagnosis, inflammatory  markers, cytokines, acute‑phase reactants, biomarkers and COVID‑19, SARS‑COV‑2, and coronavirus.” Results: Four hundred and twelve (412) articles were retrieved following the removal of duplicates, of which 15 articles were included in this study after meeting the study inclusion criteria. The included studies comprised 2828 COVID‑19 positives made of 1472 (52.1%) male and 1356 (47.9%) female patients.

Background: With the on ‑ going epidemic of Lassa fever and the rising incidence of Covid‑19 pandemic in Nigeria, there has been efforts from government and stakeholders in health towards controlling the surge of these diseases. This study is a multi‑center survey involving frontline health‑care workers, from 102 health institutions. Methodology: Pretested self‑administered questionnaires were sent through online Google form to health‑care workers across various health institutions through their respective social media platforms. Their consent was sought and the questionnaires were filled through registered emails. Multiple entry from same individual was prevented. The number of respondents was 451. The information gathered include biodata of health‑care workers, details of their cadre and years of practice, their level of standard precautions and preparedness of their health institutions. Data gathered were collated, summarized, and analyzed using simple tables with proportions. Results: The practice of standard precaution was inadequate with only 59.4% of respondents washing their hands regularly after touching patients or carrying out procedures, while only 34.4% of them used face masks while consulting patients with respiratory symptoms. As for preparedness of health institutions in control of Lassa fever and Covid‑19, 63.1% and 77.6% of respondents affirmed that their health institutions had written protocol of managing infectious diseases and had organized workshop on Lassa fever and/or Covid‑19, respectively, while only 45.5% and 20% of respondents had dedicated isolation wards and functional intensive care units in their health institutions. Conclusion: The standard safety precautions by health‑care workers were suboptimal and preparedness of their health institutions was generally inadequate for the  management and control of infectious diseases.

Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), and novel coronavirus (COVID-19) are the three major coronaviruses of present-day global human and animal health concern. COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2 is identified as the newest disease, presumably of bat origin. Different theories on the evolution of viruses are in circulation, yet there is no denying the fact that the animal source is the skeleton. The whole world is witnessing the terror of the COVID-19 pandemic that is following the same path of SARS and MERS, and seems to be more severe. In addition to humans, several species of animals are reported to have been infected with these life-threatening viruses. The possible routes of transmission and their zoonotic potentialities are the subjects of intense research. This review article aims to overview the link of all these three deadly coronaviruses among animals along with their phylogenic evolution and cross-species transmission. This is essential since animals as pets or food are said to pose some risk, and their better understanding is a must in order to prepare a possible plan for future havoc in both human and animal health. Although COVID-19 is causing a human health hazard globally, its reporting in animals are limited compared to SARS and MERS. Non-human primates and carnivores are most susceptible to SARS-coronavirus and SARS-CoV-2, respectively, whereas the dromedary camel is susceptible to MERS-coronavirus. Phylogenetically, the trio viruses are reported to have originated from bats and have special capacity to undergo mutation and genomic recombination in order to infect humans through its reservoir or replication host. However, it is difficult to analyze how the genomic pattern of coronaviruses occurs. Thus,increased possibility of new virus-variants infecting humans and animals in the upcoming days seems to be the biggest challenge for the future of the world. One health approach is portrayed as our best way ahead, and understanding the animal dimension will go a long way in formulating such preparedness plans.

Every country of the world keeps responding to the challenges posed by covid-19 in all aspects of human endeavour with high demand and burden on health care. The report of the first case in Rwanda on 14th March 2020 was accompanied by actions to drive control measures by the government of Rwanda importantly to prevent the spread of COVID-19. Those measures included education on personal preventive behaviours, social distancing and restricting the movement of people locally, nationally and internationally resulting to lockdown that allowed only essential services. Lockdown has particularly affected Rwandan families with pregnant mothers in the context of childbirth preparation in different aspects.  This review paper articulates the possible various dimensions of influence of the COVID-19 lockdown on birth preparedness by families and the possible maternal and neonatal health adverse outcomes that may be associated. This is with the intention of helping health care providers and other stakeholders anticipate, track and prepare for appropriate mitigation to reduce maternal-neonatal morbidity and mortality.   French title: Implications du verrouillage de COVID-19 sur la préparation des enfants dans les familles RwandaisesLe monde est actuellement confronté à la pandémie virale mortelle appelée maladie à coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19), précédemment appelée 2019-nouveau coronavirus (2019-nCoV).

Le rapport du premier cas au Rwanda le 14e mars 2020 a été accompagné d'actions à conduire des mesures de contrôle par le gouvernement du Rwanda important pour prévenir la propagation de Covid-19. Ces mesures comprenaient une éducation sur les comportements personnels de prévention, la distanciation sociale et la restriction de la circulation des personnes aux niveaux local, national et international, entraînant un verrouillage qui n'autorisait que les services essentiels. Le verrouillage a particulièrement affecté les familles Rwandaises de mères enceintes dans le cadre de la préparation à l'accouchement sous différents aspects.

The outbreak started in Wuhan, China, in December 2019 and began to spread rapidly to more than 100 countries and territories. By March 11, the World Health Organization (WHO) had officially declared COVID-19 a pandemic. Objective: To review the effectiveness of American and South Korean testing approaches of the COVID-19 plan. Method: Daily reports of the USA’s and South Korea’s COVID-19 cases from February 15 to April 15, 2020 were examined. The outcome of interest was total number of cases and tests per one million population, daily cases reported, and percentage of recovered cases and case fatality rate (CFR). Data were analysed using Microsoft excel sheet and tables and figures generated. Result: As of April 15 2020, USA’s and South Korea’s number of cases per million population are 1,946 and 207 cases, respectively. The daily American confirmed cases of COVID-19 had been increasing steadily from February 15 to April 15, 2020. Our study shows that South Korea and the USA recovered cases were 97% and 63%, respectively, while the case fatality rate in the USA was 37% and 3% in South Korea. Conclusion: Despite its advanced health care systems, the USA is currently experiencing a devastating virus that has claimed many lives. This is because the USA has approached the outbreak differently. The evidence suggests that South Korea’s aggressive testing has effectively managed to control the spread of COVID-19, it increases the recovered rate and reduced the CFR more than the USA’s conservative testing approach. Although the South Korea health care system is not comparable to those in the developing countries, it worth mentioning that its plan would suit well these countries and should be adopted.

In this review, we attempted to discuss the current summary of evidence of some medication, currently in trial for the treatment of COVID-19. Material and Methods: We have done an electronic literature search using the following database: PubMed, Medline, Scopus and Google scholar. These databases were searched using the keywords COVID-19 and pharmacological therapy. Results: At present, there are no well randomized controlled studies which can give evidence for most of the therapy used for COVID-19. Several  medications are in trials for COVID-19, among them: 1/ chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine; 2/anti-virals oseltamivir, remdesivir, lopinavir/ritonavir and other protease inhibitors; 3/antibiotics macrolide (Azithromycin); 4/cytokine therapy interferon; 5/ humanized monoclonal antibody tocilizumab; 6/adjunct therapies vitamins C, D, and herbal medicine; 7/ COVID-19 convalescent plasma; 8/systemic steroids; 9/expected COVID-19 vaccine. We have also included some of the herbal medicines that are commonly and widely used in the Middle East, Asia as well in Sudan, (black seeds, honey and Acacia Nilotica). It is worth mentioning that these herbal medicines have shown benefits in treating other diseases, but the evidence of their benefit in COVID-19 still needs to be established. Conclusion: Currently there is no pharmacological therapy for the COVID-19. More research and randomized clinical trials are needed to find  effective therapy or vaccine against COVID-19.

At the time of writing, neither a cure nor a vaccine has been approved by the World health organization (WHO) for this disease. Given the fact that the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) viruses have a genetic sequencing similar to SARS-CoV-2, and since the use of convalescent plasma therapy (CP) has proved its efficacy in SARS and MERS virus infections, researchers are starting to focus more on it as apossible therapy for the COVID-19 disease. The main objective of this rapid review is to report and summarize the published evidence on the role of convalescent plasma therapy in the current COVID-19 pandemic.Method: The PICO method was used to establish the review question. Moreover, papers were gathered from PubMed and Google scholar, critically appraised for the best evidence. Piersons 5-component scheme was used to check the quality of the review papers.Results: After website screening: 10 papers in PubMed and 6 papers from Google scholars were retrieved. There were encouraging reports  regarding the uses of CP in the previous viral outbreaks likes SARS and Ebola, yet there is still a doubt on the efficacy of this mode of therapy in the current COVID-19 pandemic.Conclusion: CP is a very promising treatment approach for COVID-19 patients; however, more clinical trials are required to validate the  effectiveness of this therapy.

Objectives: This review aims to investigate the association of lymphocyte count, CRP, LDH, and D-Dimer with the severity of COVID-19. Methods: This review was conducted according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines.  The databases of MEDLINE/PubMed, WHO-Virtual Health Library (VHL), and ScienceDirect were used for the systematic search. Random effects model was used to estimate the pooled standardized mean differences (SMD) with the corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI), using OpenMeta Analyst software. Results: A total of 11 studies, with 2437 COVID-19 patients, which fulfilled the eligibility criteria were included in the meta-analysis. The analysis  revealed that lymphocyte count was significantly lower in patients with the severe form of COVID-19 (SMD = - 1.025, P value <.001). Also, the analysis of SMD showed that patients with severe COVID-19 have a significantly higher serum levels of CRP (SMD = 3.363, P value <.001), D-Dimer (SMD = 1.073, P value <.001), and LDH (SMD = 3.345, P value <.001). Conclusion: Low lymphocyte count and high levels of CRP, LDH, and D-Dimer are associated with severe COVID-19.

The objective of this article is to highlight the efforts of the Ministry of Health in Sudan in mitigating the pandemic and reflecting on counteracting factors.Methods: We traced the reports and plans of the Federal Ministry of Health and looked at the models projecting the pandemic in Sudan.Results: The fundamental plan of the government of Sudan to cope up with the pandemic included the control of the source of infection, blocking transmission, and preventing the spread. The response mechanism had a multi-sector approach with involvement of government, civil society organizations, and non-governmental organizations (NGOs). The action plans involved protocols for COVID-19 diagnosis and treatment, surveillance, epidemiological investigation, and management of case contacts. However, several factors continued to jeopardize the mitigation efforts of these plans. At the time of writing this article (at the end of the May 2020), there were about 4,000 confirmed cases, 300 recoveries, and 170 deaths. Although these numbers are below the projected numbers in many proposed models, in the light of the limited testing capacity, case identification and contact tracing, the exact situation might not be ascertained.Conclusion: Sudan has prepared a national plan to prevent and contain COVID19 pandemic.
